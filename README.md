# :page_facing_up: About This Project

I found a framework that run actions in a browser simulating a real user. This framework is called Selenium and can be used to test websites or automate tasks.

## :fire: Motivation

Where I'm currently working exists many tasks that can be automated, so I'm learning this tool to help my team and the company.
